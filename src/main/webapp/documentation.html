        <h3 class="lead"><strong>Inheritance</strong></h3>
        <pre><strong>Documentation</strong>

        Our inheritance strategy pretty much followed the model that was handed out for the assignment.

        Both the <i>Person-</i> and <i>Company</i>-entitys <strong>extends</strong> InfoEntity. 
        [Side note: Company class is not really used for anything in our project].

        We allowed Person to have multiple hobbies and the same hobby to be assigned to multiple persons, 
        so we used a <i>“ManyToMany”-relation"</i>. 
        [Note: This originally resulted in a lot of critical and crashing errors, 
        which fixed with the help of Nikki, by adding “transient”to the variable declaration.

        A <i>“OneToMany”</i> relation was used between <i>InfoEntity</i> and <i>Phone</i>, to allow multiple <i>Phones</i> to be assigned to the same <i>InfoEntity</i>.

        A <i>“ManyToOne”</i> relation was used between <i>InfoEntity</i> and <i>Address</i>, so that we can have multiple <i>InfoEnty’s</i> and One <i>Address</i> assigned to them.  
        
        A <i>“ManyToOne”</i> relation between <i>Address</i> and <i>CityInfo</i>, so that <i>CityInfo</i> can have multiple <i>Address</i> and that a <i>Address</i> can only be assigned to one <i>CityInfo</i>.

        <h3 class="lead"><strong>Flow 2 Feedback</strong></h3>
        <pre><strong>Feedback</strong>
        
        <strong>Positive:</strong> General good demo’s and examples given during class. 
        
        <strong>Exception Handling:</strong> 
        The whole lecture with Thomas regarding how to handle Errors and mappers on Wednesday the 8th of March was, quite frankly,
        a disaster. Thomas spent about 1 hour of lecturing and talking about the concept of handling errors (which was good), 
        but then tried to demo an example which for some reason wouldn’t work and then told us that we could look at the example code on Github 
        and that would be all for today. 
        It felt disjointed and unprepared. 
        To his credit though, the example on Github pretty much worked flawlessly. 

        <strong>Exercises</strong>
        A lot of the exercises and their explanations/instructions felt like they hadn’t been tested or double checked for errors, 
        road-blocks or unused technology.

        <strong>SP5</strong>
        SP5 was probably the biggest and most time consuming SP to-date. 
        The daily exercises were pretty huge for something that was supposed to be completed with a day
        and while they were (mostly) not part of the actual SP5 handing, they were required to have been completed and done,
        in order to do/solve the actual SP-exercises for hand-in.  In other words: 
        It felt like we had to do the double amount of exercises for the week, yet only present/hand-in half of them.
        
        While on the subject, the exercise for Day 2 was especially huge! 
        It felt like it should have been spread over 2 days, instead of 1. 
        <a href="https://github.com/CphBusCosSem3/Exercises/blob/master/SP/SP5/REST_JAX-RS_ex2.pdf" >Day 2 exercise</a>
        

        <strong>Flow 2</strong> 
        The length of 4 weeks, combined with he amount of new stuff and topics, might just be a tad too much.  
        There were A LOT of new topics and a lot of details to learn and master and (what felt like) too little time
        to really delve into the nitty-gritty details, because of the huge exercises. 

        <strong>CA2</strong> 
        Didn’t get the answers or help we wanted from the teachers regarding a critical error we had while building the database/backend,
        and instead had to rely on our fellow students to come up with solutions. 
       
        <strong>Extra Study Points </strong>
        While on the topic of help, Nikki from group 3 should be awarded extra study points for having helped us greatly. 
        When we couldn’t figure out why our backend was throwing all sorts of tantrums and errors 
        (which was due to our Hobbies entity class ArrayList of Persons lacking a ‘transient’ declaration), 
        Nikki stepped up and helped us untangled the mess we had gotten our self into. Without his help and knowledge, 
        we would probably never have been able to identify the issue.

        Extra study points should also be awarded to Group 4 (Martin, Menja & Hannibal), 
        who gave us constructive feedback during development and also helped us with smaller parts of the program.

        <h3 class="lead"><strong>Testing the System</strong></h3>
        <pre><strong>How to Test the System</strong>
        
        <i><strong>REST Assured-test</strong></i>
        Before the Rest Assured Tests can run, the database must be populated with data. 
        To do this, make sure that the project has a persistence unit attached to the entities. 
        Then run the class “DatabaseInit” that is in the utility-package. 
        Make sure that data has been created by running the project, or using a mysql-viewer client. 
        Now that these steps have been completed, the Rest Assured Test can now be run. 
        This test class is located under the test packages in the rest package. 
        Each test method has been commented in the code.

        <i><strong>How to use the System</strong></i>
        Using the system is easy and intuitive. 
        The navigation bar at the top will give the option to view the project, open a link to GitHub, open a link to the Java Documentation 
        and the documentation of the project. 
        When viewing the project, two buttons at the top will let the user update the table, or create a new person. 
        The table will list all the persons on the database, and each user will have two options associated to it – delete and edit.

        </pre>
